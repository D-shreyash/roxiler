### Steps to Run the Project

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/repository-name.git
   cd repository-name
Install dependencies for both client (React) and server (Node.js):

For the client (React):

bash
Copy code
cd front_end
npm install
For the server (Node.js):

bash
Copy code
cd ../back_end
npm install
Run the development servers:

To run the React development server:

bash
Copy code
cd front_end
npm start
To run the Node.js backend server:

bash
Copy code
cd back_end
npm start
The React app should now be running at http://localhost:3000, and the backend at http://localhost:5000.

Usage
Frontend: The frontend is built using React.js and communicates with the Node.js backend using API requests.
Backend: The backend is built using Node.js and Express, and exposes RESTful APIs to interact with the frontend.
Ensure both servers are running for full functionality.

Technologies Used
Frontend:

React.js
Axios (for API requests)
React Router (for navigation)
CSS/SCSS (for styling)
Backend:

Node.js
Express.js
MongoDB (or any other database)
dotenv (for environment variables)
CORS (for cross-origin requests)
