# Roxiler Assignment

## Project Overview
This is a full-stack web application with a React frontend and a Node.js backend. The frontend communicates with the backend using RESTful API requests.

## Steps to Run the Project

### 1. Clone the Repository
Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/repository-name.git
cd repository-name
2. Install Dependencies
For the Client (React)
Navigate to the front_end directory and install the required dependencies:

bash
Copy code
cd front_end
npm install
For the Server (Node.js)
Navigate to the back_end directory and install the required dependencies:

bash
Copy code
cd ../back_end
npm install
3. Run the Development Servers
React Development Server
To run the React development server, navigate to the front_end directory and start the server:

bash
Copy code
cd front_end
npm start
The frontend will be running at http://localhost:3000.

Node.js Backend Server
To run the Node.js backend server, navigate to the back_end directory and start the server:

bash
Copy code
cd back_end
npm start
The backend will be running at http://localhost:5000.

4. Usage
Frontend: Built using React.js, Axios (for API requests), React Router (for navigation), and styled with CSS/SCSS.
Backend: Built using Node.js and Express, and exposes RESTful APIs to interact with the frontend.
Ensure both servers (frontend and backend) are running for full functionality.
